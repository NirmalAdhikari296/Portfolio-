        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Nirmal. I am 15 years old and currently studying in Grade 9. I am from the Morang District of Nepal, a place that has shaped much of who I am. I have many hobbies and interests that I enjoy in my free time, and they help me learn, stay creative, and express myself better. Through this portfolio, I want to share my background, the things I enjoy doing, and the experiences that make me who I am.</p>

    <section class="Background">
        <h2>My life and goals</h2>
        <p>I was born in Damak, Nepal, but my ancestral home is in Rangeli. I spent my first year living in my ancestral home before moving to Butwal, where I lived for three years. When I was four, my family shifted to Pokhara, and that’s where I spent the next ten years studying and creating countless memories. Pokhara holds a special place in my heart—the laughter with friends, school adventures, and all the little moments that made my childhood unforgettable. Last year, while in Grade 8, I had the chance to revisit my birth district, which was both nostalgic and exciting. Looking ahead, my dream is to become an IT engineer and move to America to live there happily with my family.

            <h3>Watching Anime</h3>
            <p>Watching anime is one of my favorite hobbies. I enjoy it because anime combines beautiful art, interesting characters, and powerful stories that keep me entertained for hours. It allows me to explore different worlds, cultures, and ideas. Many anime series also teach valuable lessons about friendship, courage, and never giving up. For me, anime is more than entertainment as it is a source of inspiration and creativity.</p>

            <p>Playing video games is a hobby that I really enjoy in my free time. I am especially interested in story-based games, which allow me to dive into amazing worlds filled with interesting characters and gripping adventures. These games keep my mind active and spark my creativity. Along with that, I love playing FC Mobile because it combines strategy, skill, and competition. Building teams, improving players, and competing in matches makes the game exciting every day. Gaming not only entertains me but also helps me relax and improves my problem-solving and quick-thinking abilities.</p>
